BioSignal-Pi
============
# Requirements:
* Collect data from the ADAS
* Store collected data 
* Vizualize sampled data in real time and from file 
* Collect data at different rates
* Lead-off detection
* Highly modular with interchangable parts
* PiFace controllability
* HRV Analysis
* Blue-tooth communication
* Independently testable classes (dependency reduction)

**FIRST SKELETON**
* Collect mock data through Device Manager
* Use correct stream object for the data
* No vizulization only save to file
* Settings singleton set with const values
* Test??

To be run on computer and RPI
