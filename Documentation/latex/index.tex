Biosignal PI aim is to provide a flexible and affordable open-\/source platform and tools for physiological and biological measurements such as blood pressure, blood glucose, weight, body composition, activity monitoring, and brain and cardiac activity.\+In first step, electrocardiogram (E\+CG) with wide usage in diagnosing and monitoring of heart disease and even in monitoring the autonomic nervous system through heart-\/rate variability (H\+RV) is developed.

This version provides 5-\/12 leads E\+CG and respiration measurement system based on Raspberry PI, a credit-\/card-\/size single-\/board computer, and A\+D\+A\+S1000. A\+D\+A\+S1000 is introduced by Analog Devices includes all the components necessary to perform a five-\/lead E\+CG digital conversion with respiration and pacemaker-\/artefact detection in a single chip.
